      We’re interested in the idea of the “souvenir”—who it’s for, how it’s represented, and what it’s capable of. We think souvenirs can be magical, but generally have found those in NYC to be passive objects; nostalgic of times / places / people / events / experiences that tourists can’t possibly have a personal connection to as these no longer exist. We’re interested in an alternative form; one that’s more specific and personal and participatory for the individual seeking such totems.

      <i>Today in New York</i> is a prompt. It is our attempt at offering tourists a platform to create mementos as opposed to simply buying them.
